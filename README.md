# The Sun Is Dead
No more Sun, a bunch of Girjus's took over Earth and also 360 no-scoped the Sun. The rest of humanity hopped on the Battle Bus and landed on Mars, after smashing some Mars rocks together we got bored and wanted to go back to Earth. 
They made a FIFA World Cup looking ahhhhh to buff the Sun HP by alot (alot), they sent a funny man with a hammer to go fix the Sun Shooter 6000 (it was already fixed). But the Girjus's have started spamming 11 elixir at the bridge, you also forgot your gold scar on Mars, good thing king tower is activated.

## ---> WARNING
This game is best played with trial and error, however if you are noob I can help you with some tips below yes
<br><br>
Try and locate all 3 resources quickly, you can use your hammer to plan where you want stuff to go<br>
After lighting up and locating all 3 resources try getting a smelter and then a harvester on iron ore<br>
If around this time Wave 1 appears, use basic turrets or smg turrets to fend off for now<br>
Get harvesters on each resource so you dont run out, get additional harvesters if that resource is lacking<br>
Wave 4 is considered pretty scary (imo) consider getting up additional defense<br>
Finish with your smelters and harvesters<br>
Light up the area more and start preparing lots of defense <br>
Place Smg turrets around the outside and ranger turrets where ever(they have inf range)<br>
GOOD LUCK!<br>
