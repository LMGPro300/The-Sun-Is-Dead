# The Sun Is Dead
No more Sun, a bunch of Girjus's took over Earth and also 360 no-scoped the Sun. The rest of humanity hopped on the Battle Bus and landed on Mars, after smashing some Mars rocks together we got bored and wanted to go back to Earth. 
They made a FIFA World Cup looking ahhhhh to buff the Sun HP by alot (alot), they sent a funny man with a hammer to go fix the Sun Shooter 6000 (it was already fixed). But the Girjus's have started spamming 11 elixir at the bridge, you also forgot your gold scar on Mars, good thing king tower is activated.
